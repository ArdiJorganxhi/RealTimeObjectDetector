# Detecting objects in real-time!

This application detects different objects in real-time using phone's camera. It shows you the detected object name and accuracy of it. Object detection model is gained by Apple's machine learning models and we used ResNet50 model for object detection. 

Before running the project, make sure you download the neccesary models:

After running the project, you won't be able to see results through your iOS Simulator due to unavailability of camera access, you should deploy project to your iPhone and test it.
